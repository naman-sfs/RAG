Due\\nto vigorous physical development, children at this age need up to 10.5 hours\\nper day of sleep. Since children are now active in school and socializing\\nmore, especially if they are not immunized, some of the early childhood\\ndiseases such as measles, mumps, or chickenpox may resurface.

Examples of fine motor skills are holding a pencil to write, tying\\nshoelaces, buttoning a shirt, turning the pages of a book, and cutting with\\nscissors. Children in this age group must get plenty of exercise and\\nmovement to strengthen their gross motor skills along with practicing with\\nsafe instruments, such as child scissors, to work on their fine motor skills.\\nHereditary and biological factors also influence the rate of muscle\\nstrengthening and the use of motor skills. In addition, having older siblings\\nor role models such as older classmates or playmates helps to develop both\\ngross and fine motor skills faster.\\nFigure 5-2. Science Class in Early Childhood.

Consideration can be given to children’s lack\\nof maturity and experience, and how they can help their tween avoid pitfalls.\\nAs parents, we sometimes fail to acknowledge this important period that\\noccurs just before the adolescent years. The reality is that the tween years\\nhold great significance in positively contributing to an individual’s teen\\nyears – those years in between middle childhood and adolescence –\\nprecisely, the tween years.\\nThe Sequence of Physical Changes at Puberty\\nThe growing population of females with more body fat and a higher body\\nmass index (BMI) is contributing to the earlier maturation of girls in the\\nUnited States and Europe. The average age for girls’ first menstrual period\\nin Western countries is 12 years old. Statistics in developed countries show\\nthat girls from 1900 to 1970 had the start of their menarche three to four\\nmonths younger every decade. This is partly due to improvements in health,\\nnutrition, and hygiene. Females with less body fat who start serious exercise\\nearly on often start their first period later. In addition, girls in poorer regions\\nof the world, where malnutrition is widespread, often experience menarche\\nlater than those in developed countries.\\nMany American parents prepare their daughters for the first period or\\nmenarche. Schools often have a fifth-grade program that introduces girls to\\nthe basic facts. Parents, particularly mothers, often better prepare\\nthemselves for their daughter’s phase of puberty; however, boys may not\\nexperience the same support from family. Therefore, they may seek\\ninformation or support from their peers about changes in puberty. Most of\\nthe information that boys get is from reading materials or their peers. Often,\\nthe first sign of puberty in boys is the growth of their testicles and scrotum,\\nand pubic and armpit hair soon begin to grow. Around the same time, the\\npenis begins to enlarge. Body development impulses usually begin after the\\ntesticles and penis have expanded, usually at about 14 years of age. At the\\npeak of body growth, the face and body hair begin to grow. Boy’s voices\\nsound deeper because the larynx stretches, and the vocal cords lengthen.\\nGirls’ voices are also quieter, but to a lesser extent than boys’ voices.\\nSpermarche, the first ejaculation of seminal fluid, usually occurs between\\nthe ages of 13 and 14 years (Arnett, 2013).', metadata={'source': 'B1.pdf', 'file_path': 'B1.pdf', 'page': 202, 'total_pages': 273, 'Producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext', 'Author': '.', 'Creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 22 for Word', 'CreationDate': \"D:20240221043351Z00'00'\", 'ModDate': \"D:20240221043351Z00'00'\"})]}"
